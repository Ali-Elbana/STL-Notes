## <font color="yellow"><u>What is std::forward_list?</u></f>

`std::forward_list` is a container class template provided by the C++ Standard Library. It represents a singly linked list, where each element is stored in a separate node that contains a link to the next node in the list. The `std::forward_list` container is part of the C++11 standard and is defined in the `<forward_list>` header.

Here are some key features and characteristics of `std::forward_list`:

1. Singly Linked List: `std::forward_list` stores its elements in a singly linked list data structure. Each node contains the element value and a pointer to the next node in the list. Unlike `std::list`, it does not support backward traversal from a node.

2. Dynamic Size: The size of a `std::forward_list` can change dynamically as elements are added or removed. It does not have a fixed capacity like `std::array` or `std::vector`.

3. Forward Iteration: Iteration over the elements of a `std::forward_list` is done in a forward direction. You can use iterators to traverse the list, but they only support moving forward to the next element.

4. Efficient Insertion and Removal: `std::forward_list` provides efficient insertion and removal operations at the beginning of the list or after a given position. These operations have a constant time complexity of O(1) as they involve updating the links between nodes.

5. Limited Random Access: `std::forward_list` does not provide direct random access to elements using the subscript operator (`[]`) or the `at()` function. To access elements, you need to traverse the list sequentially from the beginning to reach the desired position.

6. Memory Efficiency: Compared to other list-like containers such as `std::list` or `std::deque`, `std::forward_list` generally has a lower memory overhead. It only needs to store the element value and the next node pointer, without requiring additional space for backward links.

7. No Reverse Iteration: `std::forward_list` does not support reverse iteration. If you need to iterate in reverse order, you would either need to use additional data structures or consider using `std::list` instead.

`std::forward_list` provides a lightweight and efficient container for scenarios where forward iteration, dynamic size changes, and efficient insertion/removal at the beginning or after a given position are the primary requirements.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Example:</u></font>

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `std::forward_list`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <forward_list>

int main() 
{
    // Create a forward_list of integers
    std::forward_list<int> numbers;

    // Insert elements at the beginning of the list
    numbers.push_front(3);
    numbers.push_front(2);
    numbers.push_front(1);

    // Insert an element after a specific position
    auto it = numbers.begin();
    std::advance(it, 2);
    numbers.insert_after(it, 4);

    // Traverse and print the elements
    for (const auto& num : numbers) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Remove the second element
    it = numbers.begin();
    std::advance(it, 1);
    numbers.erase_after(it);

    // Traverse and print the elements after removal
    for (const auto& num : numbers) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create a `std::forward_list` called `numbers` to store integers. We then insert elements at the beginning of the list using `push_front()`. After that, we use `insert_after()` to insert an element after a specific position in the list.

Next, we traverse the list and print the elements using a range-based for loop. We also demonstrate how to remove an element from the list using `erase_after()`.

The output of the program will be:
```
1 2 4 3
1 4 3
```

As you can see, the elements are stored in the `std::forward_list` in the order they were inserted, and we can manipulate the list by inserting and removing elements at specific positions.

|Method|Functionality|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`push_front()`|Inserts an element to the beginning of the forward list, increasing its size by one.|`std::forward_list<int> fl; fl.push_front(10); // fl now contains {10}`|
|`pop_front()`|Removes the first element of the forward list, reducing its size by one.|`std::forward_list<int> fl = {1, 2, 3}; fl.pop_front(); // fl now contains {2, 3}`|
|`size()`|Returns the number of elements in the forward list. This operation is not supported by std::forward_list, and calling it will result in a compilation error. To obtain the size of a forward list, you can use the distance algorithm with its begin and end, which is an operation that takes linear time.|`std::forward_list<int> fl = {1, 2, 3}; std::cout << std::distance(fl.begin(), fl.end()); // prints 3`|
|`empty()`|Returns whether the forward list is empty (i.e. whether its size is 0).|`std::forward_list<int> fl; std::cout << fl.empty(); // prints 1 (true)`|
|`front()`|Returns a reference to the first element in the forward list.|`std::forward_list<int> fl = {1, 2, 3}; std::cout << fl.front(); // prints 1`|
|`insert_after()`|Inserts elements after the specified position in the forward list.|`std::forward_list<int> fl = {1, 2, 3}; fl.insert_after(fl.begin(), 4); // fl now contains {1, 4, 2, 3}`|
|`emplace_after()`|Constructs an element in-place after the specified position in the forward list.|`std::forward_list<std::string> fl = {"Hello", "World"}; fl.emplace_after(fl.begin(), "there"); // fl now contains {"Hello", "there", "World"}`|
|`erase_after()`|Removes elements after the specified position in the forward list.|`std::forward_list<int> fl = {1, 2, 3}; fl.erase_after(fl.begin()); // fl now contains {1, 3}`|
|`swap()`|Exchanges the content of the forward list by the content of another forward list of the same type.|`std::forward_list<int> fl1 = {1, 2, 3}; std::forward_list<int> fl2 = {4, 5, 6}; fl1.swap(fl2); // fl1 now contains {4, 5, 6} and fl2 now contains {1, 2, 3}`|
|`merge()`|Merges two sorted forward lists into one. The lists should be sorted into ascending order.|`std::forward_list<int> fl1 = {1, 3, 5}; std::forward_list<int> fl2 = {2, 4, 6}; fl1.merge(fl2); // fl1 now contains {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and fl2 is empty`|
|`splice_after()`|Transfers elements from one forward list to another.|`std::forward_list<int> fl1 = {1, 2, 3}; std::forward_list<int> fl2 = {4, 5, 6}; fl1.splice_after(fl1.before_begin(), fl2); // fl1 now contains {4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3} and fl2 is empty`|
|`remove()`|Removes all elements from the forward list that are equal to a given value.|`std::forward_list<int> fl = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2}; fl.remove(2); // fl now contains {1, 3, 4}`|
|`remove_if()`|Removes all elements from the forward list that satisfy a given predicate.|`std::forward_list<int> fl = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; fl.remove_if({return n % 2 == 0;}); // fl now contains {1, 3, 5}`|
|`reverse()`|Reverses the order of the elements in the forward list.|`std::forward_list<int> fl = {1, 2, 3, 4}; fl.reverse(); // fl now contains {4, 3, 2, 1}`|
|`unique()`|Removes all but the first element from every consecutive group of equal elements in the forward list.|`std::forward_list<int> fl = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4}; fl.unique(); // fl now contains {1, 2, 3, 4}`|
|`sort()`|Sorts the elements in the forward list, altering their position within the container.|`std::forward_list<int> fl = {3, 1, 4, 2}; fl.sort(); // fl now contains {1, 2, 3, 4}`|
|`emplace_front()`|Constructs an element in-place at the beginning of the forward list.|`std::forward_list<std::string> fl; fl.emplace_front("Hello"); // fl now contains {"Hello"}`|
