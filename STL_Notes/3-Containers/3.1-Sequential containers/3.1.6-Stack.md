## <font color="yellow"><u>What is std::stack?</u></f>

std::stack is a container adaptor class in C++ that provides the functionality of a stack, which is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. It means that the elements are inserted and removed from the same end of the container, known as the top of the stack. The class template acts as a wrapper to the underlying container, which can be any standard container class or some other specifically designed container class. The underlying container must support the following operations: empty(), size(), back(), push_back(), and pop_back(). The standard container classes std::vector, std::deque, and std::list satisfy these requirements. [By default, if no container class is specified for a particular stack class instantiation, the standard container std::deque is used](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/stack)[1](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/stack).

<u>Here is an example of how to use std::stack:</u>

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

int main()
{
    // create an empty stack of integers
    std::stack<int> s;

    // push some elements into the stack
    s.push(10);
    s.push(20);
    s.push(30);

    // print the size of the stack
    std::cout << "The size of the stack is " << s.size() << "\n";

    // print the top element of the stack
    std::cout << "The top element is " << s.top() << "\n";

    // pop some elements from the stack
    s.pop();
    s.pop();

    // print the size of the stack after popping
    std::cout << "The size of the stack after popping is " << s.size() << "\n";

    // check if the stack is empty
    if (s.empty())
        std::cout << "The stack is empty\n";
    else
        std::cout << "The stack is not empty\n";

    return 0;
}
```

The output of this program is:

```
The size of the stack is 3
The top element is 30
The size of the stack after popping is 1
The stack is not empty
```

## <font color="yellow"><u>std::stack methods:</u></f>

|Method|Functionality|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`push()`|Inserts an element into the stack, maintaining the LIFO order.|`std::stack<int> s; s.push(10); // s now contains {10}`|
|`pop()`|Removes the top element from the stack, maintaining the LIFO order.|`std::stack<int> s = {10, 9, 8}; s.pop(); // s now contains {9, 8}`|
|`top()`|Returns a reference to the top element of the stack, which is the last element inserted.|`std::stack<int> s = {10, 9, 8}; std::cout << s.top(); // prints 10`|
|`size()`|Returns the number of elements in the stack.|`std::stack<int> s = {10, 9, 8}; std::cout << s.size(); // prints 3`|
|`empty()`|Returns whether the stack is empty (i.e. whether its size is 0).|`std::stack<int> s; std::cout << s.empty(); // prints 1 (true)`|
|`emplace()`|Constructs an element in-place at the top of the stack.|`std::stack<std::string> s; s.emplace("Hello"); // s now contains {"Hello"}`|
|`swap()`|Exchanges the contents of two stacks of the same type.|`std::stack<int> s1 = {10, 9, 8}; std::stack<int> s2 = {7, 6, 5}; s1.swap(s2); // s1 now contains {7, 6, 5} and s2 now contains {10, 9, 8}`|
