## <font color="yellow"><u>What is std::deque?</u></f>

std::deque is a container class in C++ that provides the functionality of a double-ended queue, which is a data structure that allows fast insertion and deletion at both its front and back. Unlike std::vector, the elements of a deque are not stored contiguously in memory, but rather in separate chunks that are linked together. This means that accessing elements by index requires two pointer dereferences, but also that the deque can grow or shrink without copying or moving its elements. A deque is useful when you need to add or remove elements from both ends of a sequence, and you donâ€™t need direct access to the middle elements.

<u>Here is an example of how to use std::deque:</u>

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>

int main()
{
    // create an empty deque of integers
    std::deque<int> d;

    // push some elements into the deque
    d.push_back(10); // insert 10 at the back
    d.push_front(20); // insert 20 at the front
    d.push_back(30); // insert 30 at the back
    d.push_front(15); // insert 15 at the front

    // print the size of the deque
    std::cout << "The size of the deque is " << d.size() << "\n";

    // print the elements of the deque using an iterator
    std::cout << "The elements of the deque are: ";
    for (auto it = d.begin(); it != d.end(); ++it) {
        std::cout << *it << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";

    // print the elements of the deque using an index
    std::cout << "The elements of the deque are: ";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < d.size(); ++i) {
        std::cout << d[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";

    // pop some elements from the deque
    d.pop_front(); // remove the first element
    d.pop_back(); // remove the last element

    // print the size of the deque after popping
    std::cout << "The size of the deque after popping is " << d.size() << "\n";

    // print the front and back elements of the deque
    std::cout << "The front element is " << d.front() << "\n";
    std::cout << "The back element is " << d.back() << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

The output of this program is:

```
The size of the deque is 4
The elements of the deque are: 15 20 10 30 
The elements of the deque are: 15 20 10 30 
The size of the deque after popping is 2
The front element is 20
The back element is 10
```

As you can see, std::deque allows us to insert and delete elements from both ends of the container, and access them by index or iterator. This is one example of how std::deque can be used in a C++ program.

## <font color="yellow"><u>std::deque methods:</u></f>

|Method|Functionality|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`push_front()`|Inserts an element to the beginning of the deque, increasing its size by one.|`std::deque<int> d; d.push_front(10); // d now contains {10}`|
|`push_back()`|Inserts an element to the end of the deque, increasing its size by one.|`std::deque<int> d; d.push_back(10); // d now contains {10}`|
|`pop_front()`|Removes the first element of the deque, reducing its size by one.|`std::deque<int> d = {1, 2, 3}; d.pop_front(); // d now contains {2, 3}`|
|`pop_back()`|Removes the last element of the deque, reducing its size by one.|`std::deque<int> d = {1, 2, 3}; d.pop_back(); // d now contains {1, 2}`|
|`size()`|Returns the number of elements in the deque.|`std::deque<int> d = {1, 2, 3}; std::cout << d.size(); // prints 3`|
|`empty()`|Returns whether the deque is empty (i.e. whether its size is 0).|`std::deque<int> d; std::cout << d.empty(); // prints 1 (true)`|
|`at()`|Returns a reference to the element at specified location pos, with bounds checking. If pos is not within the range of the container, an exception of type std::out_of_range is thrown.|`std::deque<int> d = {1, 2, 3}; std::cout << d.at(1); // prints 2`|
|`front()`|Returns a reference to the first element in the deque.|`std::deque<int> d = {1, 2, 3}; std::cout << d.front(); // prints 1`|
|`back()`|Returns a reference to the last element in the deque.|`std::deque<int> d = {1, 2, 3}; std::cout << d.back(); // prints 3`|
|`insert()`|Inserts elements at the specified location in the deque.|`std::deque<int> d = {1, 2, 3}; d.insert(d.begin() + 1, 4); // d now contains {1, 4, 2, 3}`|
|`erase()`|Removes elements from the specified location in the deque.|`std::deque<int> d = {1, 2, 3}; d.erase(d.begin() + 1); // d now contains {1, 3}`|
|`swap()`|Exchanges the content of the deque by the content of another deque of the same type.|`std::deque<int> d1 = {1, 2, 3}; std::deque<int> d2 = {4, 5, 6}; d1.swap(d2); // d1 now contains {4, 5, 6} and d2 now contains {1, 2, 3}`|
|`emplace_front()`|Constructs an element in-place at the beginning of the deque.|`std::deque<std::string> d; d.emplace_front("Hello"); // d now contains {"Hello"}`|
|`emplace_back()`|Constructs an element in-place at the end of the deque.|`std::deque<std::string> d; d.emplace_back("World"); // d now contains {"World"}`|
|`emplace()`|Constructs an element in-place at the specified position in the deque.|`std::deque<std::string> d = {"Hello", "World"}; d.emplace(d.begin() + 1, "there"); // d now contains {"Hello", "there", "World"}`|
|`shrink_to_fit()`|Requests the deque to reduce its capacity to fit its size.|`std::deque<int> d(10); d.resize(5); d.shrink_to_fit(); // d now has capacity 5`|
|`resize()`|Resizes the deque so that it contains n elements.|`std::deque<int> d(5); d.resize(10); // d now contains 10 elements, 5 of them are 0`|
|`clear()`|Removes all elements from the deque, leaving the container with a size of 0.|`std::deque<int> d = {1, 2, 3}; d.clear(); // d is now empty`|
