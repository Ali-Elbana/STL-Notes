## <font color="yellow"><u>What is std::sort?</u></font>

std::sort is a function in the C++ standard library that can sort a range of elements in a container, such as an array, vector, or list. It can sort the elements in ascending or descending order, depending on the comparison function or object that is passed as an argument. It can also work with different types of data, such as integers, strings, or user-defined classes, as long as they support the necessary operations for comparison and swapping. std::sort is defined in the `<algorithm>` header file and is part of the STL algorithms library.

To use std::sort, you need to provide two iterators that define the range of elements to be sorted. For example, if you have a vector of integers named `v`, you can sort it by calling `std::sort(v.begin(), v.end())`. This will sort the elements from the beginning to the end of the vector using the default comparison operator `<`. If you want to sort the elements in reverse order, you can pass a custom comparison function or object that returns true when the first argument is greater than the second. For example, you can use a lambda expression like this: `std::sort(v.begin(), v.end(), { return a > b; })`. This will sort the elements from the largest to the smallest.

std::sort is a fast and efficient sorting algorithm that uses a variation of quicksort for most cases. It has an average time complexity of O(N log N), where N is the number of elements in the range. However, it is not stable, which means that it does not preserve the relative order of equal elements. If you need a stable sorting algorithm, you can use std::stable_sort instead.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Example:</u></font>

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Create a vector
  vector<int> v = {5, 3, 2, 1, 4};

  // Print the contents of the vector
  cout << "The contents of the vector are:" << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
    cout << v[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;

  // Sort the vector in ascending order
  sort(v.begin(), v.end());

  // Print the contents of the sorted vector
  cout << "The contents of the sorted vector are:" << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
    cout << v[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;

  // Sort the vector in descending order
  sort(v.begin(), v.end(), greater<>());

  // Print the contents of the sorted vector
  cout << "The contents of the sorted vector are:" << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
    cout << v[i] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
The contents of the vector are:
5 3 2 1 4

The contents of the sorted vector are:
1 2 3 4 5

The contents of the sorted vector are:
5 4 3 2 1
```

This example demonstrates how to use std::sort to sort a vector in ascending order and descending order. You can also use std::sort to sort other types of containers, such as arrays and linked lists.
