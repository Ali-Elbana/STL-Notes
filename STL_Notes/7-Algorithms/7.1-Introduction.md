## <font color="yellow"><u>What is STL algorithms?</u></font>

STL Algorithms are a collection of powerful and versatile functions that can operate on ranges of elements in C++ containers. They can perform various tasks such as searching, sorting, modifying, copying, and transforming data using iterators and predicates. STL Algorithms are independent of the underlying container type, which means they can work with any container that supports the required iterator category. STL Algorithms are implemented as templates, which means they can handle any type of data that supports the necessary operations. STL Algorithms are part of the Standard Template Library (STL), which is a core component of the C++ standard library.

<u>Some examples of STL Algorithms are:</u>

- `std::sort`, which sorts a range of elements in ascending or descending order.
- `std::find`, which searches for an element in a range that matches a given value.
- `std::count`, which counts the number of elements in a range that satisfy a condition.
- `std::reverse`, which reverses the order of elements in a range.
- `std::transform`, which applies a function to each element in a range and stores the result in another range.

STL Algorithms can be combined with other STL components, such as containers, iterators, and functors, to create powerful and expressive programs. STL Algorithms can also be customized with user-defined types and functions, as long as they follow the conventions and requirements of the STL. STL Algorithms can improve the performance, readability, and maintainability of C++ code.

To use STL Algorithms, you need to include the `<algorithm>` header file in your program. You also need to provide valid iterators that define the range of elements to operate on, and optionally, predicates or functions that specify the criteria or logic for the algorithm.
