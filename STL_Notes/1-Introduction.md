## <font color="yellow"><u>What is STL?</u></f>

- STL in C++ stands for **Standard Template Library**, which is a collection of algorithms, data structures, and other components that can be used to simplify the development of C++ programs. The STL provides four components called algorithms, containers, functions, and iterators. The STL provides a set of common classes for C++, such as containers and associative arrays, that can be used with any built-in type and with any user-defined type that supports some elementary operations (such as copying and assignment).

- Some examples of STL containers are vectors, lists, stacks, queues, maps, sets, etc. Some examples of STL algorithms are sort, search, reverse, copy, etc. Some examples of STL functions are bind, plus, minus, etc. Some examples of STL iterators are begin, end, advance, next, prev, etc.

- The STL is a powerful and flexible tool for C++ programming. It can help you write more concise, efficient, and reusable code.
