## <font color="yellow"><u>Differences:</u></f>
  
The main difference between std::map and std::multimap is that std::map allows only unique keys, while std::multimap allows duplicate keys.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between the two containers:

|Feature|std::map|std::multimap|
|---|---|---|
|Allows duplicate keys|No|Yes|
|Key comparison function|Yes|Yes|
|Supports efficient search, insertion, and removal operations|Yes|Yes|
|Supports reverse iterators|Yes|Yes|

In addition to the key difference in whether or not duplicate keys are allowed, there are a few other minor differences between the two containers:

- std::map is typically faster than std::multimap for operations such as search and insertion, because it does not have to check for duplicate keys.
- std::multimap is more versatile than std::map, because it can be used to represent a wider variety of relationships between keys and values.

Here are some examples of when to use each container:

- Use std::map when you need to store a unique set of key-value pairs, such as a dictionary or a phone book.
- Use std::multimap when you need to store a set of key-value pairs where duplicate keys are allowed, such as a list of email addresses for a given contact or a list of courses that a student is enrolled in.
