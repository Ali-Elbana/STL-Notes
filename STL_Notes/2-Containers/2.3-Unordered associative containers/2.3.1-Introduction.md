## <font color="yellow"><u>What is unordered containers?</u></font>

Unordered containers in C++ are a group of class templates in the C++ Standard Library that implement hash table variants. They are called unordered because they do not store their elements in any particular order, unlike ordered containers such as std::map or std::set. Instead, they use a hash function to map each element to a bucket, where multiple elements can share the same bucket. This allows for fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, with an average complexity of O(1).

Unordered containers are useful when you need to store and access elements by their value, and you do not care about the order of the elements. For example, you can use an unordered container to implement a dictionary, a phone book, or a cache.

There are four types of unordered containers in C++:

- std::unordered_set: A set is a collection of unique elements. An unordered set stores its elements in an unordered fashion using a hash table.
- std::unordered_multiset: A multiset is a collection of elements that can have duplicates. An unordered multiset stores its elements in an unordered fashion using a hash table.
- std::unordered_map: A map is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. An unordered map stores its key-value pairs in an unordered fashion using a hash table.
- std::unordered_multimap: A multimap is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key can have multiple values. An unordered multimap stores its key-value pairs in an unordered fashion using a hash table.

## <font color="yellow"><u>What is hash table?</u></font>

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs in an efficient way. It uses a function called a hash function to map each key to an index in an array of buckets or slots, where the corresponding value is stored. For example, if you have a hash table that stores the names and phone numbers of your contacts, you can use the hash function to find the index of the bucket where the name and phone number of a specific contact are stored.

Hash tables have several advantages over other data structures, such as:

- They allow fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, with an average complexity of O(1).
- They can handle any type of data as keys or values, as long as they can be hashed and compared.
- They can be used to implement various abstract data types, such as dictionaries, sets, caches, etc.

However, hash tables also have some drawbacks, such as:

- They do not store the elements in any particular order, which makes it hard to iterate over them or sort them.
- They can have collisions, which occur when two or more keys are mapped to the same index by the hash function. This can reduce the performance and increase the space usage of the hash table.
- They require a good hash function that can distribute the keys evenly across the buckets and avoid clustering or patterns.
