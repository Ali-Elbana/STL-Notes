## <font color="yellow"><u>What is std::unordered_set?</u></font>

`std::unordered_set` is a container class in the C++ Standard Library that represents an unordered set of unique elements. It is part of the unordered associative container family, which also includes `std::unordered_map` and `std::unordered_multiset`. The elements in an `std::unordered_set` are stored in an unordered manner based on their hash values.

Here are some key characteristics and features of `std::unordered_set`:

1. Uniqueness of Elements: `std::unordered_set` guarantees that each element it contains is unique. Duplicate elements are not allowed, and inserting a duplicate element will have no effect on the set.

2. Hash-based Organization: The elements in an `std::unordered_set` are stored in buckets based on their hash values. This allows for efficient insertion, removal, and lookup operations, typically with an average constant time complexity of O(1).

3. No Specific Ordering: Unlike other container classes like `std::set` or `std::map`, `std::unordered_set` does not maintain a specific ordering of elements. The elements are organized based on their hash values, which means the order of elements may vary between different runs or implementations.

4. Hash Function Requirement: To use a custom type as the element type in an `std::unordered_set`, a hash function must be provided. The hash function is responsible for generating a hash value for each element, which is used to determine the bucket where the element will be stored.

5. Resolving Collisions: In case of hash collisions (when two elements have the same hash value), `std::unordered_set` uses a mechanism called separate chaining. It stores multiple elements with the same hash value in the same bucket, forming a linked list. This allows efficient access to elements with the same hash value.

6. Iteration: `std::unordered_set` provides iterators that allow for traversing the elements in the set. The order of iteration is not defined and may vary between different runs or implementations.

7. Lookup Operations: `std::unordered_set` provides fast lookup operations. Given an element, you can efficiently check whether it exists in the set using the `find()` function, which has an average time complexity of O(1). The `count()` function can also be used to check the presence of an element, returning either 1 (if the element is present) or 0 (if it is not present).

8. Memory Overhead: `std::unordered_set` typically has a larger memory overhead compared to ordered set containers like `std::set`. It needs to maintain additional data structures, such as the hash table and linked lists for collision resolution.

`std::unordered_set` provides an efficient way to store and retrieve unique elements based on their hash values, without enforcing a specific order. It is useful when fast insertion, removal, and lookup operations are required, and the order of elements is not important.

## <font color="yellow"><u>Example:</u></font>

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `std::unordered_set`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
    // Create an unordered_set of integers
    std::unordered_set<int> mySet;

    // Insert elements into the set
    mySet.insert(5);
    mySet.insert(2);
    mySet.insert(8);
    mySet.insert(2); // Duplicate element, will be ignored

    // Check the size of the set
    std::cout << "Size of the set: " << mySet.size() << std::endl;

    // Iterate over the set and print its elements
    std::cout << "Elements in the set: ";
    for (const auto& element : mySet) {
        std::cout << element << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Check if an element exists in the set
    int searchElement = 2;
    if (mySet.find(searchElement) != mySet.end()) {
        std::cout << searchElement << " is present in the set." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << searchElement << " is not present in the set." << std::endl;
    }

    // Remove an element from the set
    int removeElement = 8;
    mySet.erase(removeElement);

    // Check the updated size of the set
    std::cout << "Size of the set after removal: " << mySet.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create an `std::unordered_set` called `mySet` to store integers. We insert elements into the set using the `insert()` function, including a duplicate element (2) that is ignored. We then retrieve the size of the set using the `size()` function and iterate over the set to print its elements.

Next, we search for an element (2) using the `find()` function and check if it exists in the set. We remove an element (8) from the set using the `erase()` function. Finally, we print the updated size of the set.

The output of the program will be:

```
Size of the set: 3
Elements in the set: 2 5 8
2 is present in the set.
Size of the set after removal: 2
```

This example demonstrates the basic usage of `std::unordered_set`, including insertion, removal, iteration, and lookup operations.
