## <font color="yellow"><u>Differences:</u></f>

<u>The differences between std::count and std::count_if are:</u>

- std::count counts the number of elements in a range that are equal to a given value, while std::count_if counts the number of elements in a range that satisfy a given predicate.
- std::count uses the operator== to compare the elements with the value, while std::count_if uses the predicate to evaluate the elements.
- std::count requires the elements and the value to be of the same or compatible types, while std::count_if only requires the elements to be of a type that can be passed to the predicate.

Both functions have a linear time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of elements in the range. Both functions do not require the range to be sorted or have any particular order.
