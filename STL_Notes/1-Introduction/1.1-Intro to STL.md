## <font color="yellow"><u>What is STL?</u></f>

- STL in C++ stands for **Standard Template Library**, which is a collection of algorithms, data structures, and other components that can be used to simplify the development of C++ programs. The STL provides four components called algorithms, containers, functions, and iterators. The STL provides a set of common classes for C++, such as containers and associative arrays, that can be used with any built-in type and with any user-defined type that supports some elementary operations (such as copying and assignment).

- Some examples of STL containers are vectors, lists, stacks, queues, maps, sets, etc. Some examples of STL algorithms are sort, search, reverse, copy, etc. Some examples of STL functions are bind, plus, minus, etc. Some examples of STL iterators are begin, end, advance, next, prev, etc.

- The STL is a powerful and flexible tool for C++ programming. It can help you write more concise, efficient, and reusable code.

- There are three main types of STL containers, which are classes that store and manipulate data:

	1. **Sequential containers**: These are containers that store data in a linear fashion, such as arrays, lists, vectors, stacks, and queues. They allow fast insertion and removal of elements at the ends, but may be slower in the middle. They also support efficient random access to elements using indices or iterators.
	2. **Associative containers**: These are containers that store data in a sorted order, such as sets, maps, and multisets. They allow fast search, insertion, and removal of elements based on keys or values. They do not support random access to elements using indices, but only using iterators.
	3. **Unordered associative containers**: These are containers that store data in an unsorted order, such as unordered sets, unordered maps, and unordered multisets. They use hash tables to organize the data, which allows fast search, insertion, and removal of elements based on keys or values. They do not support random access to elements using indices or iterators.
