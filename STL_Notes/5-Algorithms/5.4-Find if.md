## <font color="yellow"><u>What is std::find_if?</u></font>

std::find_if is a function in the C++ standard library that can search for an element in a range of elements, such as an array, vector, or list, that matches a given predicate. A predicate is a function or an object that returns a boolean value when applied to an element. std::find_if returns an iterator to the first element in the range that satisfies the predicate, or the end iterator if no such element is found. std::find_if is defined in the `<algorithm>` header file and is part of the STL algorithms library.

To use std::find_if, you need to provide two iterators that define the range of elements to be searched, and the predicate to be applied to each element. For example, if you have a vector of integers named `v`, you can search for the first odd number by calling `std::find_if(v.begin(), v.end(), { return x % 2 == 1; })`. This will return an iterator to the first element in the vector that is odd, or `v.end()` if no such element exists.

std::find_if has a linear time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of elements in the range. It performs at most N calls to the predicate until it finds a match or reaches the end of the range. It does not require the range to be sorted or have any particular order.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() 
{
  // Create a vector
  vector<int> v = {5, 3, 2, 1, 4};

  // Find the first element in the vector that is even
  vector<int>::iterator it = find_if(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int x) { return x % 2 == 0; });

  // If the element is found, print its value
  if (it != v.end()) {
    cout << "The first even element in the vector is " << *it << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "There is no even element in the vector" << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}

```

Output:

```
The first even element in the vector is 2
```
