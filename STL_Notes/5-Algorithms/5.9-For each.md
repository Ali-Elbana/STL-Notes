## <font color="yellow"><u>What is std::for_each?</u></font>

std::for_each is a function in the C++ standard library that can apply a function to a range of elements in a container, such as an array, vector, or list. It is defined in the `<algorithm>` header file and is part of the STL algorithms library. It can work with any container that supports iterators, which are objects that can point to and traverse the elements in a container. It uses the function or object that is passed as an argument to perform an operation on each element in the range.

To use std::for_each, you need to provide two iterators that define the range of elements to be processed, and a function or an object that defines the operation to be applied to each element. For example, if you have a vector of integers named `v`, you can print each element by calling `std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), { std::cout << x << " "; })`. This will use a lambda expression as a function object to print each element in `v`.

std::for_each has a linear time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of elements in the range. It performs at most N calls to the function or object until it processes all the elements or reaches the end of the range. It does not return anything, but modifies the original container if the function or object modifies the elements.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Create a vector of integers
  vector<int> v = {5, 3, 2, 1, 4};

  // Print the elements of the vector using std::for_each
  std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int x) { cout << x << " "; });
  cout << endl;

  // Increment all of the elements of the vector using std::for_each
  std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int& x) { x++; });

  // Print the elements of the vector again
  std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int x) { cout << x << " "; });
  cout << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
5 3 2 1 4
6 4 3 2 5
```

std::for_each applies a given function to each element of a sequence. It takes three iterators as arguments:

- The first iterator points to the beginning of the sequence.
- The second iterator points to the end of the sequence.
- The third argument is a function object that is applied to each element of the sequence.

std::for_each can be used to apply any type of function to the elements of a sequence. This makes it a very powerful and versatile function.
