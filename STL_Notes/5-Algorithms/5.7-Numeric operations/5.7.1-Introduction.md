## <font color="yellow"><u>What are Numeric operations?</u></f>

Numeric Operations in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) refer to algorithms that operate on numeric values. These algorithms are part of the `<numeric>` header and are specifically designed for numeric computations. Here are some key numeric operations provided by the STL:

1. **`std::accumulate`**:
    - Calculates the sum of a range of values.
2. **`std::inner_product`**:
    - Calculates the inner product of two ranges.
3. **`std::partial_sum`**:
    - Computes the partial sum of elements in a range.
4. **`std::iota`**:
    - Fills a range with incrementing values.

These numeric algorithms provide convenient and efficient ways to perform common operations on numeric sequences. They are particularly useful when working with mathematical computations or processing numerical data in a range.
