## <font color="yellow"><u>What are Modifying sequence algorithms?</u></f>

Modifying sequence operations in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) are a category of algorithms that operate on the elements of a sequence (like a `std::vector`, `std::list`, or `std::deque`) and modify the sequence in some way. These algorithms typically change the content or order of elements within the sequence.

Here are some common modifying sequence operations provided by the `<algorithm>` header:

1. **`std::copy`:**
    - Copies elements from one range to another. It's used for duplicating elements from one container to another or within the same container.
2. **`std::move`:**
    - Moves elements from one range to another. This is used when you want to efficiently transfer the ownership of elements to a different container.
3. **`std::transform`:**
    - Applies a function to each element in a range and stores the result in another range. It's used for performing a specified operation on each element and storing the result in a different container.
4. **`std::remove`:**
    - Removes elements with a specific value from a range. It doesn't actually erase the elements from the container but moves the unwanted elements to the end and returns an iterator pointing to the new logical end.
5. **`std::remove_if`:**
    - Removes elements for which a predicate is true. Similar to `std::remove`, it shifts unwanted elements to the end.
6. **`std::replace`:**
    - Replaces occurrences of a specified value with another value in a range. It's used for substituting one value with another.
7. **`std::replace_if`:**
    - Replaces elements for which a predicate is true with a specified value.
8. **`std::swap`:**
    - Swaps the values of two elements. It's used for exchanging the values of two elements within a sequence.
9. **`std::fill`:**
    - Assigns the specified value to every element in a range. It's used for filling a range with a constant value.
10. **`std::fill_n`:**
    - Assigns the specified value to the first n elements in a range.

These modifying sequence operations are powerful tools for manipulating the contents of containers and are essential for a variety of tasks in C++ programming. They provide a concise and expressive way to modify the content of sequences.
