## <font color="yellow"><u>What are Set operations?</u></f>

Set operations refer to a group of algorithms that perform operations similar to those in set theory. These algorithms are particularly useful when working with sorted ranges (sequences) of elements. The set operations include:

1. **`std::set_union`:**
    - Computes the union of two sorted ranges. The result contains all distinct elements from both ranges.
2. **`std::set_intersection`:**
    - Computes the intersection of two sorted ranges. The result contains only the elements that are common to both ranges.
3. **`std::set_difference`:**
    - Computes the difference of two sorted ranges. The result contains the elements present in the first range but not in the second.
4. **`std::set_symmetric_difference`:**
    - Computes the symmetric difference of two sorted ranges. The result contains the elements that are present in either of the ranges, but not in both.

These set operations assume that the input ranges are sorted, and they produce results with the same ordering. The resulting ranges are usually also sorted.

These algorithms are particularly useful when working with sets or containers that model sets and you need to perform set-like operations efficiently. The use of sorted ranges allows these algorithms to achieve their purposes with good performance characteristics.
