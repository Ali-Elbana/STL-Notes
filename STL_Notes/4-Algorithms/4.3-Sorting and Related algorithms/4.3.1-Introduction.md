## <font color="yellow"><u>What are Sorting and Related algorithms?</u></f>

Sorting and related operations in `std::algorithm` refer to functions that deal with arranging elements in a specified order within a range of elements, typically in a sequence container like `std::vector` or an array. These operations are crucial for organizing data in a way that allows for efficient searching and retrieval.

Here are some common sorting and related operations provided by the `<algorithm>` header:

1. **`std::sort:`**
	- Sorts the elements in a specified range in ascending order.
2. **`std::partial_sort:`**
	- Partially sorts the elements in a specified range in ascending order up to a specified middle position.
 3. **`std::nth_element:`**
	- Rearranges elements in a specified range such that the element at the nth position is in its sorted position.
 4. **`std::merge:`**
	- Merges two sorted ranges into a single sorted range.
 5. **`std::inplace_merge:`**
	- Merges two consecutive sorted ranges in-place.

These sorting and related operations are fundamental for various applications, including searching, retrieving, and maintaining ordered data structures. They are efficient and essential tools in a C++ developer's toolbox when dealing with algorithms that require sorted input data.
