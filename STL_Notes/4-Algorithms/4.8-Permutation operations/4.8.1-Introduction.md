## <font color="yellow"><u>What are Permutation operations?</u></f>

In C++, the `<algorithm>` header provides a set of permutation operations that operate on ranges of elements in containers. Permutation operations involve rearranging elements in a range, creating different orderings of the elements. Here are some of the key permutation operations in `std::algorithm`:

1. **`std::next_permutation`**:
    - Rearranges the elements in the range `[first, last)` into the next lexicographically greater permutation. Returns `true` if such a permutation exists; otherwise, returns `false` (if the current permutation is already the largest lexicographically).
2. **`std::prev_permutation`**:
    - Rearranges the elements in the range `[first, last)` into the next lexicographically smaller permutation. Returns `true` if such a permutation exists; otherwise, returns `false` (if the current permutation is already the smallest lexicographically).

Both `std::next_permutation` and `std::prev_permutation` work on bidirectional iterators and require the elements in the range to be sorted in ascending order. These functions return a boolean value indicating whether a valid permutation was found.

Note: Before using these permutation operations, ensure that the range is sorted in ascending order. The permutations generated are lexicographically ordered.
