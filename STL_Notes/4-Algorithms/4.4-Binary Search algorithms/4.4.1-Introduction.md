## <font color="yellow"><u>What are Binary search algorithms?</u></f>

In the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), the `<algorithm>` header provides several binary search operations that operate on sorted ranges of elements. These algorithms are designed to efficiently find elements within sorted containers. Here are the key binary search operations:

 1. `std::binary_search`:
	- Determines whether an element exists in a sorted range.
2. `std::lower_bound`:
	- Finds the first position where an element could be inserted in a sorted range without disrupting the order.
3. `std::upper_bound`:
	- Finds the last position where an element could be inserted in a sorted range without disrupting the order.
 4. `std::equal_range`:
	- Finds a range containing all elements equivalent to the specified value.

These binary search operations are commonly used in scenarios where the data is sorted, as they provide efficient ways to locate elements within the range. Always ensure that the range is sorted before applying these algorithms.
