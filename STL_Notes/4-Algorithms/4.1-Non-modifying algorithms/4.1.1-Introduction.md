## <font color="yellow"><u>What are Non-modifying sequence algorithms?</u></f>

Non-modifying sequence operations in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) are algorithms that perform operations on sequences (such as containers like `std::vector` or `std::list`) without modifying the elements within the sequence. These algorithms are often used to inspect, search, or count elements within a range. 

Here are some key non-modifying sequence operations provided by the `<algorithm>` header:

1. **`std::for_each`:**
    - Applies a function to each element in a range.
2. **`std::count`:**
    - Counts the occurrences of a value in a range.
3. **`std::count_if`:**
    - Counts the elements in a range for which a predicate is true.
4. **`std::find`:**
    - Finds the first occurrence of a value in a range.
5. **`std::find_if`:**
    - Finds the first element in a range for which a predicate is true.
6. **`std::find_if_not`:**
    - Finds the first element in a range for which a predicate is false.
7. **`std::search`:**
    - Searches for a subsequence within a range.
8. **`std::search_n`:**
    - Searches for a subsequence of identical elements within a range.
9. **`std::equal`:**
    - Checks if two ranges are equal.
10. **`std::mismatch`:**
    - Finds the first position where two ranges differ.
11. **`std::all_of`:**
    - Checks if all elements in a range satisfy a condition.
12. **`std::any_of`:**
    - Checks if any element in a range satisfies a condition.
13. **`std::none_of`:**
    - Checks if no elements in a range satisfy a condition.

These non-modifying sequence operations are valuable for tasks that involve searching, counting, or examining elements within a sequence without altering the sequence itself. They provide a wide range of functionalities for working with data in a read-only manner.
