## <font color="yellow"><u>What are Heap operations?</u></f>

Heap operations in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) involve manipulating sequences as heaps, which are specialized binary trees that satisfy the heap property. The heap property ensures that the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. The `<algorithm>` header in C++ provides several functions for heap operations. Here are some key heap operations:

1. **`std::make_heap`:**
    - `std::make_heap(first, last)` rearranges the elements in the range `[first, last)` to form a max heap.
2. **`std::push_heap`:**
    - `std::push_heap(first, last)` adds the element at position `(last - 1)` to the max heap defined by `[first, last - 1)`.
3. **`std::pop_heap`:**
    - `std::pop_heap(first, last)` moves the maximum element from the max heap defined by `[first, last)` to the position `last - 1` and rearranges the remaining elements to form a valid max heap.
4. **`std::sort_heap`:**
    - `std::sort_heap(first, last)` sorts the elements in the max heap `[first, last)` in ascending order.

These functions make it convenient to work with heaps in C++, especially in scenarios where you need to manage the priority of elements efficiently.
