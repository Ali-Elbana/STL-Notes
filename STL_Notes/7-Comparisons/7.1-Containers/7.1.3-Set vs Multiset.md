## <font color="yellow"><u>Differences:</u></f>

**std::set** and **std::multiset** are both associative containers in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) that store elements in sorted order. However, there are a few key differences between the two containers:

|Feature|std::set|std::multiset|
|---|---|---|
|Allows duplicate elements|No|Yes|
|Key comparison function|Yes|Yes|
|Supports efficient search, insertion, and removal operations|Yes|Yes|
|Supports reverse iterators|Yes|Yes|

In other words, std::set is a container that stores a unique set of elements in sorted order, while std::multiset is a container that stores a set of elements in sorted order, allowing duplicate elements.

<u>Here is a table of examples to illustrate the difference between the two containers:</u>

|Operation|std::set|std::multiset|
|---|---|---|
|Inserting the elements 1, 2, 3, and 1|Stores the elements 1, 2, and 3 in sorted order|Stores the elements 1, 2, 3, and 1 in sorted order|
|Finding the element 2|Returns an iterator to the element 2|Returns an iterator to the first occurrence of the element 2|
|Counting the number of occurrences of the element 1|Returns 1|Returns 2|
|Erasing the element 1|Erases the element 1 from the container|Erases the first occurrence of the element 1 from the container|

std::set and std::multiset are both powerful and efficient containers that can be used to solve a variety of problems. Which container you choose to use depends on your specific needs. If you need to store a unique set of elements in sorted order, then std::set is a good option. If you need to store a set of elements in sorted order, allowing duplicate elements, then std::multiset is a good option.
