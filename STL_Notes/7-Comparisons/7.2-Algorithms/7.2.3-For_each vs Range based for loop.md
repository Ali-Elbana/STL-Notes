## <font color="yellow"><u>Differences:</u></f>

<u>The differences between std::for_each and range based for loop are:</u>

- std::for_each is a function that applies a function or an object to each element in a range, while range based for loop is a syntax that executes a statement for each element in a range.
- std::for_each can be used as an argument to bind, and the third argument is already a functor, while range based for loop is more similar to a regular for loop.
- std::for_each can be used with any container that supports iterators, while range based for loop can be used with any container that supports begin() and end() functions.
- std::for_each does not return anything, but modifies the original container if the function or object modifies the elements, while range based for loop does not modify the original container unless the statement does so .
- std::for_each can break from a range without abusing an exception, while range based for loop can use the break keyword to exit the loop .
